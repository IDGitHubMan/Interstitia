# Welcome!

## Basics

### What is Interstitia?

Interstitia is meant to be a database that collects projects from mulitple people and places them on a live Django-flavored website. Thus far, it only has my and [@Killerstrike1234's](https://github.com/Killerstrike1234) projects.

### What is at Interstitia?

I made interstitia as a portfolio because the projects I had made and were working on didn't neatly fit into one group. They are mostly programs that produce artistic and interactive results, or simple tools. I feel that I am probably not the only one who operates in the strange world that is creative coding, and wanted to make a community where I and others could share our work and projects, as well as assist each other in their efforts.

### Who can be a part of Interstitia?

### ***Anyone***
Anyone is free to engage, and contribute! Only thing is, avoid foul/disrespectful/hateful language, and remember that we are a community meant to engage and work with each other. You can join our (also work in progress) [discord](https://discord.gg/wqUvuFDnUB)! At the moment, we only have a few members, but we hope this becomes a much bigger and more official thing!

On the discord, there are instructions on how to become a contributor, but so far that is the only role, since we don't really have need for playtesters, assistants, etc. (At least not yet.)

### Where is the website?

At the moment, the website is not live yet, since websites are expensive, and the website is not fully built. It *will* be though, probably in a few months. Here is what it looks like so far:

![Home Page:](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1up0rDeC3m1ASvGA16ZVnYjTPFXitt22v)
![Collections Page:](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1HawfoZqgskDrKroWwnRGiDe6Lq4FxKGo)   
It includes a bunch of cool animations too, made with [Processing](https://processing.org/). I personally like the dark, mysterious vibe. Contributors will be able to add projects to the website by filling out a really easy form. Thanks to Django/python, most of the process is automated!
